Hi [name],

The 179th edition of the Groundhog Day Event will take place next 2nd of February. Last year ...

They are looking for talks about these subjects: ...

They don't make their speakers pay, but they reimburse travel and share their profits with them!

[name], I think you could submit a proposal for this event. [reason]

The event organization provides help to prepare the talk, but I'm here as well for giving you feedback. It's a great opportunity, [name]! Preparing a talk provides awesome reflection moments and it's useful to learn more and more. Attendees will ask you questions which will provide you other perspectives. If you don't know to answer a question, don't worry, ask audience for help. It's about sharing! Don't miss this opportunity, [name]!

Furthermore, the event includes a code of conduct, to ensure the event goes off without incidents and that everybody is welcome.
