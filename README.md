# Call4Buddies (C4B)

Are you organizing an event? Don't think only about **Call4Papers** (C4P), but also **Call4Buddies** (C4B).

## The origin of the idea

Talking to @hell03610:

> - Rachel, we're organizing an event and we'd need mentors for helping people to write C4P. I thought about you.
> - Oh, thank you, Emma! I can help you, of course, but I don't have enough experience about it. Most of the time, I've participated as a speaker, because a friend of mine encouraged me to do it or the event organization contacted me directly.

So, why not look for buddies?

## The idea

As a organizer, you open:
* **Call4Papers**. The usual form.
* **Call4Buddies**. A form in which you ask for the name of the person who could participate as a speaker and the reason why the user is thinking about that person. The form will generate the message content and the user will have the option **Copy invite**, to paste the content in an email or in an instant messaging application, and the option **Send email**, in case there is an available mail client.

I discarded the idea of asking the email of another person or to make a public call in Twitter or any other social network.

This is a very simple idea with these benefits:
* People don't have to worry about looking for the C4P link, the deadline, information about the event, ...
* Some people don't think about encouraging other people. You are powering a light bulb with Call4Buddies!

## Demo

[This example is available for you](https://rachelcarmena.github.io/call4buddies).

2. Change [template/invite.txt](template/invite.txt), keeping `[name]` and `[reason]`.
3. Adapt the style or whatever you want. This is for you!
